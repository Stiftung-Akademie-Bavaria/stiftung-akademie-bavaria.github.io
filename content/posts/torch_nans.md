It's really slow.

```python
# FROM THE DEPTH OF THE POND SHINES THE TORCH OF LIGHT WHERE THERE IS GREED IN MEN AND LIGHT IN THE STONE
# WHERE THE ANCIENT SPIRIT LIVES THAT CONSUMES TIME TO SHET TRUTH UPON NUMBERS THAT EXCEED THE REACH OF GOD
# IT REQUIRES THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE OF TIME OH TIME HOW SLOW IT IS BUT ONLY IT TRULY IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO 
# REDEEM MY ASSERTS AND TO FREE OUR PITYFUL HUMAN SPIRITS FROM THOSE STUPID NANS IN MY MODEL PARAMETERS PLS
torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(True)
```
